# DisAVR: Disentangled Adaptive Visual Reasoning Network for Diagram Question Answerin

## Introduction
Diagram Question Answering (DQA) aims to correctly answer the question about the given diagram, which demands an interplay of good diagram understanding and effective reasoning. In this paper, we propose a Disentangled Adaptive Visual Reasoning Network for DQA, named DisAVR, which jointly optimizes the dual-process of representation and reasoning. DisAVR mainly consists of three modules including improved region feature learning, question parsing, and disentangled adaptive reasoning.
